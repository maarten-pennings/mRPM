# mRPM
Maarten's RPM project

## Introduction
This project describes how to make a RPM (rotations per minute) meter.
It uses an ESP8266, a 4 times 8x8 LED matrix and a line tracking sensor.
I made this upon request of Jan Ridders from [Jan Ridders Modelbouw](http://www.ridders.nu/).
He needs to measure the speed of his stirling, steam or combustion engines.
The ESP8266 was chosen because it is easy and cheap; this project does not (yet?) use the WiFi capabilities of the ESP8266.

See [YouTube](https://youtu.be/PuOR1rizvE4) for a demo of the project.
